I'm Rituraj, a 27 year old front-end engineer from Gurgaonj, IN, working as a Interactive developer at [Sapient](http://sapient.com). Founder of [Maddyzone](//tech-blog.maddyzone.com.io) and [open source](//github.com/riturajratan) lover.

I've been fortunate enough to travel the world speaking and teaching Angular and JavaScript. I've taught workshops for Google, Virgin Media, Salesforce, General Assembly employees and many more.

Co-created [Conditionizr](http://conditionizr.com) (.NET Magazine's Open Source Project of the Year finalist), partnered with Intel and Rolling Stone to bring an HTML5 experience to life. Many other brands have recognised and used/shared my ideas/code: Rolling Stone, Intel, Adobe, NASA, HTML5 Hub, AppendTo, Google, Esquire, Microsoft/MSDN, Wired, Huffington Post, KitKat, Smashing Magazine, Net Magazine, TechPro.

### Contact

Want to ask a general question? Use my [GitHub AMA](//github.com/toddmotto/ama) for that!

I most likely will not respond to individual code queries due to the volume and time constraints, please defer to StackOverflow (sorry)!

[Tweeting me](//twitter.com/toddmotto) is the fastest way to get hold of me.

To chat to me about something else such as a JavaScript/Angular training, speaking or workshop event, please email me through my <a href="https://courses.toddmotto.com/pages/contact" target="_blank">contact form</a>.
