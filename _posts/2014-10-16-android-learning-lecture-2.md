# How Android can be Installed


- Before Android Installation, we first need to know about system specification on which android can be work and
what are the system requirement for successful android installation.

In Concern of System Platform where Android Platform can be  that you can start your Android application development on either of the following operating systems:

- Microsoft Windows XP or later version.

- Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later version with Intel chip.

- Linux including GNU C Library 2.7 or later.

So Now as we got the Operating System here , where we can install the Android Platform, We must need to know about
Minimum System Requirement Also:

-  32-bit and 64-bit ARM, MIPS, x86, x86-64 Processior

-  512 MB of RAM

Now after getting knowledge of hardware and operating system for android installation , we now move to steps for installation.

- At First , we check if our system structure have JDK (Java Development Kit) Already installed or not, if not then we have
to first download it.

A Question can comes in your mind , why we need JDK here to install?

So dear my answer is here for your common question

-  if you check our first lecture regarding android learning you got Android applications are developed using Java. So As a result, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is the first component and that must be installed.

Please check our first lecture for android learning , if you are not aware of this :

[http://maddyzone.com/mobile/android-learning-lecture-1](http://maddyzone.com/mobile/android-learning-lecture-1)

Android Installation for Development Requires Standard Edition of the Java Platform Development Kit version 6 or higher.


## **  **How to Setup Java SDK




### **  Step-1 (Downloading Java SDK)**


To Download JDK , Please check below link :

[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

- As you open the link , you will see page looks like as shown in snapshot below :

[![step1]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step1.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step1.png)

- Here you got JDK , Server JRE , JRE from among three option, you have to only choose JDK link to download.

- Once you click on download you will move to below link :

[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

- As you can check it is same as shown in snapshot below :

[![step2]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step2.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step2.png)

- Here you got lots of options of JDK version for different-different platform like : Linux , Mac OS , Windows.

- Now we are only considering here for Windows JDK installation, so you have to check option for windows version either
Windows x86 or  Windows x64 as per your system configuration,after selecting " Accept License Agreement  " option.

- Once you download complete JDK to your system downloads folder than launch the installation executable and follow the on screen instructions to complete the installation process.


#### **Step-2 (Installing Java SDK)**


As you start the installation first screen will show you the welcome message to installation wizard and guide you to complete
installation as below snapshot

[![step3]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step3.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step3.png)

When you click on next button from here , you will move to next screen shown as below :

[![step4]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step4.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step4.png)

Here you can choose the mode of installation and where do you want to install Java SDK in your system (way to choose location)
by default development tools are selected as option , and you can move to next screen by clicking next button directly or by changing location path of installation.

As you click on next button you will move to next screen shown as below :

[![step5]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step5.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step5.png)

below  :

[![step6]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step6.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step6.png)

On this screen , you can change the destination folder for installation , otherwise click to next button for complete installation of Java SDK as shown below :

[![step7]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step7.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step7.png)

After Successful completion of progress bar on this stage , you will move to next screen showing with message  like "Java SE Development Kit version number successfully installed" looks in screen below :

[![step8]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step8.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/step8.png)



As we successfully complete Java SDK we now move to our next step of Android Installation by name "How to Setup Android SDK".




## **How to Setup Android SDK**


- Before going to move to Android SDK installation steps , we have to first know what is Android SDK for?

- So in this concern, Android SDK provides API libraries and developer tools necessary to build, test, and debug apps for Android.

- Now Android SDK installation so much easier as ADT Bundle is available which includes the required Android SDK components and a version of the Eclipse IDE with built-in ADT (Android Developer Tools).

- So Start our step by step process to Android SDK Installation from here.


### **Step-1 (Downloading Android SDK with Eclipse ADT)**


- First We download the ADT Bundle mention from the below url :

[https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

- After hitting this url you will get the webpage looks like below snapshot

[![Android SDK Location to Download]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-SDK-Location-to-Download.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-SDK-Location-to-Download.png)



- You can see here a button to download the Android SDK with Eclipse IDE by name "Download Eclipse ADT with the Android SDK for Windows", while click on this you will get a screen look below.



[![Android SDK  Agreement and Window Version]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-SDK-Agreement-and-Window-Version.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-SDK-Agreement-and-Window-Version.png)

- On this screen you have to check the checkbox for mention terms and condition to agree with, and than choose one of the option for your window version like 32 bit or 64 bit.

- After made these selection you are able to click on button shown below on this page by name "Download Eclipse ADT with the Android SDK for Windows".

- Once click on this button downloading start and save the zip file to specific directory of your system drives , where you want to save or in drive d:

[![download]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/download.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/download.png)

- When downloading is successful or file successfully downloaded to sepecific directory, now unzip the zip bundle and move to
our next step "Installing the Eclipse ADT Bundle with the Android SDK".


### **Step-2 (Installing Android SDK with Eclipse ADT)**


- Bundle have both Android SDK and Eclipse IDE.

To set up the Eclipse ADT Bundle with the Android SDK:

1.) Unpack the ZIP file by name like adt-bundle-<os_platform>.zip and save it to an appropriate location, such as a "Development" directory in your home directory.
2.) Open the adt-bundle-<os_platform>/eclipse/ directory and launch Eclipse.

- When you launch Eclipse , you will see the screen looks in snapshot below to create workspace(a folder name where your android apps code will placed what you will develop later on of this blog) on your system.

[![eclipse workspace]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/eclipse-workspace.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/eclipse-workspace.png)

- You can change the location of workspace, by browsing particular location, you want to save your develop apps in future.

- After Clicking on "OK" button , you will get screen looks like below in snapshot

[![Eclipse IDE]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Eclipse-IDE1.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Eclipse-IDE1.png)

- Eclipse IDE provides you way to create Android application by choosing the following option from file menu from Eclipse IDE
as :

    
    Go to File Menu -> New -> Android Application Project


Please check below snapshot

[![Android application project]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-application-project1.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-application-project1.png)

- After choosing option "Android Application Project" you will get a screen looks like below:

[![Andriod Application Creation]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Andriod-Application-Creation1.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Andriod-Application-Creation1.png)

- Here you can put your application name, you want to create and choose :

1.) Minimum Required SDK from dropdown (Android SDK Version for which you want to create apps)
2.) Target SDK from dropdown (Android SDK Target Version for which your apps will run only)
3.) Compile With from dropdown (Android SDK Version by which your apps will complile for publish)
4.) Themes from dropdown (Choose theme for your apps to display on mobile device by default)

- As you can check in snapshot all above four options are blank, and need to fill by default to create apps.

- You can done by downloading and adding SDK Packages.

- So here we move to our next step for android installation.


### Step-3 (Downloading and Adding SDK Packages)


- To Download or Adding SDK Packages we have to follow below process.

- Go to Windows menu of the Eclipse IDE than choose Android SDK Manager option like:

    
    Windows -> Android SDK Manager


See the snapshot below :

[![Android SDK Manager]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-SDK-Manager.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-SDK-Manager.png)

- Once you click on Android SDK Manager a screen will popup showing all the packages for android to install with respect to
Android Vesions available with this bundle.

See the snapshot below :

[![Android SDK Package]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-SDK-Package2.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Android-SDK-Package2.png)

- You have to choose required package or if you want to install all packages select all and click on Install Packages button.

[![Choose Package to Install]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Choose-Package-to-Install1.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Choose-Package-to-Install1.png)

- Here you can choose packages to install by accepting the agreement license as shown in below snapshot.

[![Choose Package to Install Agreement]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Choose-Package-to-Install-Agreement-1.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/10/Choose-Package-to-Install-Agreement-1.png)

- After Accepting the Agreement downloading of selected packages will start and time depends on the number of packages you choose for installation or its took about 3-4 hrs. minimum for installation.

- After complete successful package downloading , you are now get excited to know somehow about :

- How Android Application can be designed, developed and Run. ?

- How you can deploy your apps on android market world.?

So dear for all these questions and your eagerness to learn , know more about world most popular mobile platform Android and Development of apps using Android Platform , we will move to our next lecture , in which we will learn about all the above questions.

If you like please this post, please like us on social media, if you want to know more about in this topic please comment us and suggest us. We will come in our next lecture of android learning by considering your valuable feedback in our mind.
