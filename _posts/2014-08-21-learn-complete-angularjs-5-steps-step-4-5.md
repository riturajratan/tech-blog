As per my [**Previous article** ](http://maddyzone.com/javascript/learn-complete-angularjs-5-steps-step-3-5) you know Angular Directive.if you not don’t know then please first read my previous article then come on this article by this you can easily understand this article .




**So** **what have you done** **?**

Ok lets start one by one.

**What is Service in AngularJS ?**

To organize and share our code we use service.It is **singletons **or can say  substitutable objects. In simple words in this many methods are combine which are related to a specific function .like Closure in JavaScript. and it is **  Lazily instantiate  **means Angular only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.only single instance generated by the service.


<blockquote>**  **Service is** Lazily instantiate  **means Angular only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.only single instance generated by the service.  _thanks [yogesh](https://github.com/yoku2010) to clear Lazily instantiate_</blockquote>


if you don't know about closure then don't worry i am giving you a basic example by which you can understand that how it works.

    
    /** create a function vehicle or can say collection **/
    var vehicle=function(){
    // method by which "car" string return  
    var car=function(){ return "car"};
    
    // method by which "bus" string return  
    var bus=function(){return "bus"};
    
    //// method by which "bike" string return  
    var bike=function(){return "bike"};
    
    return {
    
           car_call:car,
    
           bus_call:bus,
    
           bike_call:bike
    
        }
    }


So now how we access vehicle methods ** [highlight] car [/highlight] **,** [highlight] bus [/highlight] **, [highlight] **bike**  [/highlight]

    
    /** in vehicle_call we get car_call, bus_call,and bike_call method**/
    var vehicle_Call=vehicle();
    
    // call vehicle car method
    alert(vehicle_Call.car_call());
    
    // call vehicle bus method
    alert(vehicle_Call.bus_call());
    
    // call vehicle bike method
    alert(vehicle_Call.bike_call());


**live demo**

In AngularJS there are many built-in service they all are start with ** [highlight] $ [/highlight] ** sign .like ** [highlight] $http [/highlight] , [highlight] $timeout [/highlight] , [highlight] $log [/highlight] , [highlight] $filter [/highlight] ** and many more.


<blockquote>All built-in Services start with a **$ **sign</blockquote>


Ok  for an example we will look in ** [highlight] $http [/highlight] ** service.

**How to use Service?**

we are taking a example of [highlight] **$http** [/highlight] service.so we use service in angular like below

[![how to use service in angular]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/08/service-use1.png)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2014/08/service-use1.png)



    
    //create a module
    var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);
     
    //create a Controller using $http service
    myApp.controller('BasicCtrl', ['$http', function ($http) {
     /*** $http use like below **/
      $http({method: 'GET', url: '/someUrl'}).
        success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
          // this callback will be called asynchronously
          // when the response is available
        }).
        error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
          // called asynchronously if an error occurs
          // or server returns response with an error status.
        });
    /** in short we use like below **/
    
    // for GET
     $http.get('/someUrl').success(successCallback);
    
    // for POST 
     $http.post('/someUrl', data).success(successCallback);
    
    }]);
    
    //using multiple serivce
    myApp.controller('BasicCtrl', ['$http','$scope', function ($http,$scope) {
     
     // your logic 
    
    }]);
    


**How to make Custom Service ?**

In Angular we can service very easy and when it is made it is registered in angular  then angular compiler can reference it and we can use it as a dependency at the run time .a common way to make service using [highlight] $factory [/highlight]  this is very basic example to create a service .

    
    //create a module
    var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);
    
    myApp.factory('yourservicename', function() {
        
        var serviceInstance = {};
    
        // Our custom service
        return serviceInstance;
    
      });


In general we use get and set method so here we are making a service by which we get and set a value .

**in JS**

    
    //create a module
    var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);
    
    myApp.factory("XYZ",function(){// we are registering a service as XYZ 
    var test=0;
    return {
        /** by this get test variable value**/
        "get":function(){
    
            return test;
        },
    
       /** to set new  value of test variable **/
        "set":function(passtest){
            test=5;
    
        }
    };
    
    });
    // create a  Controller and here we pass XYZ in service 
    myApp.controller('basicCtrl', function($scope,XYZ) {
         
         /** in html first value see 0 due to in
           * XYZ service test variable set 0 
         **/
         
         $scope.val_test = XYZ.get(); // return 0
    
        /** now when click on change val it comes in this 
          *  here new value set 5 because in html we are passing 5
        **/  
        $scope.changeval=function(changeval){
        
          XYZ.set(changeval);
        
          $scope.val_test = XYZ.get();    
        }  
    });


**in HTML**

    
    <div ng-app="myApp">
        <div ng-controller="basicCtrl">
        <a ng-click="changeval(10)">change value </a>
      value-- {{ val_test }}
        </div>
    
    </div>
