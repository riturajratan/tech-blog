Slight Submenu is a jQuery plugin thatis designed to  manage the  behavior of submenus and  this is highly configurable and extensible.



	
  * very easy to use and just a few kilobytes in size with full control over every aspect that the plugin touches;

	
  * _does not shadow_ any **a**'s hrefs (this is why buttons are used to expand/collapse submenus);

	
  * possibility to replace defaults globally

	
  * almost no css, as this plugin is intended to add behavior so its up to you how things will look

	
  * multilevel submenu nesting with each nesting for itself (full control, again)

	
  * inline css option allowing css to be applied inline (by default it is not) for the javascript lover and the one who would need that kind of functionality

	
  * deep nesting (loose, even uneven structure, no pun intended) for fine control even in the most markup-twisted situation or for custom scenarios (say an accordeon)
