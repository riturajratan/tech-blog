ScrollStory  jQuery Plugin is an  UI widget for building simple, scroll-based pages and interactions.



	
  * 100% style agnostic. Just a collection of often-used scroll-based patterns.

	
  * 16+ jQueryUI-style events/callbacks for various application state events.

	
  * Focus and blur event when an individual story becomes active or inactive.

	
  * Programmatically animated scroll to any item.

	
  * Items can be grouped into categories, with event dispatched as categories change.

	
  * Items filterable by user-specified tags.

	
  * Items aware of their in-viewport status.

	
  * Throttled scroll events and minimal DOM usage.
